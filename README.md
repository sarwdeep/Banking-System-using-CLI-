# Banking System (Java CLI Project)

## Project Description
The Banking System is a command-line Java application that simulates basic bank operations such as adding accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, deleting accounts, and viewing transaction history. It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Java Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is inheritance in Java?
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.

### 2. Why use the `this` keyword?
The `this` keyword refers to the current object and helps differentiate between instance variables and method parameters.

### 3. What is method overriding vs overloading?
Overloading occurs when methods have the same name but different parameters, while overriding means redefining a method of a parent class in a child class.

### 4. What is object instantiation?
Object instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class using the `new` keyword.

### 5. Explain single vs multiple inheritance.
Single inheritance means one class inherits another; multiple inheritance allows inheriting from more than one class, which Java supports only through interfaces.

### 6. What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods together while restricting direct access to internal variables.

### 7. What is constructor overloading?
Constructor overloading means having multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists to initialize objects in various ways.

### 8. Can we override static methods?
No, static methods cannot be overridden because they belong to the class, not an instance.

### 9. What is runtime polymorphism?
Runtime polymorphism occurs when a method call is resolved at runtime, typically through method overriding.

### 10. Difference between class and object?
A class is a blueprint or template, while an object is a specific instance of that class created in memory.
